# Triplex

Triplex is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol built on Aptos and other compatible chains, offering a modular architecture and flexible liquidity provision system. It introduces an innovative DeFi framework that addresses challenges faced by traditional on-chain derivatives platforms, such as liquidity acquisition and infrastructure scaling.

With Triplex, users can experience more efficient capital utilization, more flexible risk exposure, and a new level of interoperability.

## How Does It Work?

```jsx
import { useAccount } from '@triplexjs/hooks'

// Get account balance, liquidity, positions, etc.
const { data } = useAccount()
```

Triplex's frontend integration provides an intuitive user experience. By using our React hooks, you can easily integrate Triplex functionality into your application.

```jsx
import { useMarket } from '@triplexjs/hooks'

// Get market data
const { data } = useMarket('BTC-USDC')
```
